    "text": "I found my old coat in the back of the closet,\nPockets full of winter and lint.\nA ticket stub, a broken pen,\nA memory of something I meant.\nThe sleeves are too short, the buttons are gone,\nBut I wear it anyway, just for the song\nOf years that hang heavy, of warmth that remains—\nA coat is a story that never complains."

    "text": "I waited for the train that never came,\nOn a platform slick with rain and hope.\nThe clock hands spun, the pigeons flew,\nThe world kept moving, I could not cope.\nI counted the faces, the umbrellas, the sighs,\nThe announcements that echoed, the gray of the skies.\nWhen the last train left, I stood in the dark,\nA ticket to nowhere, a question, a spark."

    "text": "I wrote you a letter in blue ink and fear,\nFolded it twice, then hid it for years.\nThe words were a river, the paper a dam,\nI never could send it, I never quite am.\nNow the envelope yellows, the stamp is a ghost,\nThe letter unsent is the one I need most."

    "text": "I stand on the corner, a sentinel of night,\nCasting my glow on the lost and the late.\nI listen to secrets, to footsteps, to fights,\nI witness the lovers, the lonely, the fate.\nMy bulb may flicker, my post may rust,\nBut I hold the darkness at bay.\nI am the keeper of shadows and trust,\nUntil the breaking of day."

    "text": "Take one cup of longing, a pinch of regret,\nA tablespoon laughter, a memory set.\nStir in some silence, a dash of old pain,\nBake at a temperature just shy of sane.\nLet cool in the window, serve with a sigh—\nThis is the recipe for learning goodbye."

    "text": "You left your raincoat on the back of my chair,\nA yellow ghost in the morning light.\nI wear it sometimes, just to pretend\nThat you might come back, that we might mend.\nThe pockets are empty, the sleeves are too long,\nBut I keep it anyway, for the memory's song."

    "text": "The streetlights flicker, the pavement shines,\nMy shadow stretches, crossing lines.\nI count the steps, the cracks, the cars,\nThe distant hum of closing bars.\nThe city is quiet, the night is cold,\nI walk alone, growing old.\nBut every journey, slow or fast,\nIs just a way to reach the past."

The labyrinth stretches infinitely, challenging you to remember, to let go, and to embrace the intricate tapestry of your inner world.\n\nAt its heart lies a mirror reflecting shards of yourself—moments of triumph, whispers of despair, and the ever-present glow of resilience. In this maze, every path leads you closer to understanding the essence of being, where vulnerability and strength coexist in delicate balance."
